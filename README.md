# 🏠 Airbnb Investment Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Problem Statement

One of my friends was planning to buy an apartment in **Seattle, Washington ** to rent out on **Airbnb**. His primary concern was making a smart investment — choosing the right **location (ZIP code)**, **apartment size (number of bedrooms)**, and understanding **which seasons generate the most revenue**.

To help him make a data-driven decision, I built an **interactive dashboard** using Airbnb listing data from the Seattle region to visualize key trends and patterns that influence profitability.
